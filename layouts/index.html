  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p>
    We are a multi-disciplinary team of scientists and engineers who like doing research for fun. Our only objective is
    to publish
    good machine learning research that is useful and interesting. Our collaborators include researchers from labs like
    Google Brain, Oxford University, and
    Toronto's Vector Institute.
  </p>

  <h1>Join The Team!</h1>
  <p>
    We're looking for individuals interested in contributing to cross-institutional research projects on machine
    learning using
    neural networks. We recruit students and industrial members globally. Our only requirement is a strong background
    in
    computer science, mathematics and statistics. Remote work is our modus operandi, although we regularly organize
    working
    sessions in cities with more than one member.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    If you're interested in deep learning and neural networks, and are well-versed in calculus, statistics, and
    software development
    then you're a perfect fit.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    The team is volunteer-run, but we do provide mentorship and authorship opportunities, and we have a rich set of
    resources
    and training infrastructure at our disposal!
  </p>
  <br>
