    abstract = 'Ageing effect on pulse wave velocity (PWV) in a single arterial bifurcation is studied by means of a 0D distributed vascular model. A Gaussian process emulator is trained on a small set of simulations, and PWV is computed at system inlet. The emulator is used to predict PWV for a distribution of inputs covering physiological ranges from a typical ageing individual. Predictions are employed to compute Sobol sensitivity indices for each input parameter. Sensitivity analysis indicates vessel wall Youngâ€™s modulus as the most influential input on PWV variance. This work shows the potential of using emulators to drastically reduce computational time in a model sensitivity analysis.'
