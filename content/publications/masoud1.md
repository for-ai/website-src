    abstract = 'Trails are unstructured and typically lack standard markers that characterize roadways;  nevertheless,  trailscan  provide  an  effective  set  of  pathways  for  off-road  navigation.   Here  we  approach  the  problem  of  trailfollowing by identifying the deviation of the robot from the heading angle of the trail through the refinementof a pretrained Inception-V3 [Szegedy et al.,  2016a] Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on theImageNet dataset [Deng et al., 2009].  A differential system is developed that uses a pair of cameras eachproviding input to its own CNN directed to the left and the right that estimate the deviation of the robot withrespect to the trail direction.  The resulting networks have been successfully tested on over 1 km of differenttrail types (asphalt, concrete, dirt and gravel).'
