    abstract = 'Following off-road trails is somewhat more complex than following man-made roads. Trails are unstructuredand typically lack standard markers that characterize roadways.  Nevertheless, trails can provide an effectiveset of pathways for off-road navigation. Here we approach the problem of trail following by identifying trail-like regions; that is regions that are locally planar, contiguous with the robotâ€™s current plane and which appearsimilar to the region in front of the robot. A multi-dimensional representation of the trail ahead is obtained byfusing information from an omnidirectional camera and a 3D LIDAR. A k-means clustering approach is takenbased on this multi-dimensional signal to identify and follow off-road trails. This information is then used tocompute appropriate steering commands for vehicle motion.  Results are presented for over 1500 frames ofvideo and laser scans of trails.'
